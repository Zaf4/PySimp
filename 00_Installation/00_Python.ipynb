    "It is suggested use panultimate (one before the latest) major release of Python. Python 3 is now the golden standard and major releases follow 3.x.x convetion. So, if the latest release is **3.12.x**, use the **3.11.y**, y being the latest version, the reason being compatibility with 3rd party libraries takes some time. For this book, we will use Python 3.11.9."
