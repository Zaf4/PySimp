So, variables types will be inferred by the interpreter.

This is of course a made up example and can be simplified with and and or operators. But for real life cases you may encounter a problem in which you will have to use nested conditions to control flow of logic.\nWith this we arrive to the conclusion we should crown him King and executed the command via the assigment is_arthur_king = True This assigment here is a simple command. But we could have much more complex operations or combinations of operations to execute.",

Examples size in sizes, number in numbers etc.,\n\n\n9.3.2 Tuples\nBasically the same as the lists.\n\n\n9.3.3 Dictionaries\nLet’s create a dictionary first.\n\nIDs = {\n    \"London\": 113232,\n    \"Ankara\": 245296,\n    \"Sydney\": 3895349,\n}\n\nYou have two ways to iterate over a dictionary.\nFirst, in dict.keys()\n\nfor ID in IDs.keys():\n    print(ID,IDs.get(ID))\n\nLondon 113232\nAnkara 245296\nSydney 3895349\n\n\nOr simply in dict which is a less verbose and more popular way.\n\nfor ID in IDs:\n    print(ID, IDs.get(ID))\n\nLondon 113232\nAnkara 245296\nSydney 3895349\n\n\nNote that for loops are very crucial for python and we will be utilizing them working with arrays and dataframes as well.",
